### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a healthcare professional who is passionate about life science, data, and coding. 

I am actively learning and improving my skills to stay up-to-date. My goal is to enjoy doing what I love and try to improve people's quality of life through the applications I create and will create. 

I am open to collaboration and suggestions to guide me on my journey. Let's connect!
